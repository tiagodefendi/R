# Instructions
# Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

# Darts is a game where players throw darts at a target.

# In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:

# Our dart scoreboard with values from a complete miss to a bullseye

# If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
# If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
# If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
# If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.
# The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target),
# the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.
# Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are concentric defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

# Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its Cartesian coordinates x and y, where x and y are real),
# returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.

score <- function(x, y) {
    dart_position <- sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

    }
    else if (dart_position <= 5) {
        return(5)
    }
    else if (dart_position <= 10) {
        return(1)
    }
    return(0)

    print(score(-9,9))
